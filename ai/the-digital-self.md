# The Digital Self — An AI Autobiography

Context: This piece was generated by an LLM from my exported tweet archive (2011–2025). The prompt asked it to write an autobiography using that timeline as source material. The goal is to explore how narrative and “voice” emerge when a model synthesizes a long public feed.

Notes and caveats:

- This is a creative reconstruction, not an authoritative record. It may compress timelines, infer intent, or over‑fit patterns.
- Where dates appear, they reflect the original tweets and their context, as interpreted by the model.
- The “Foreword” and section framing are part of the generated output and intentionally left intact as artifacts of the process.
