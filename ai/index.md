# AI Projects

Two projects. Click through for details.

## [How this site was built]({{ '/ai/how-this-site-was-built/' | relative_url }})
How a coding assistant and an LLM help me build and maintain a minimal Jekyll site: small, auditable changes; simple CSS; and GitHub Pages for deployment.

## [The Digital Self — An AI Autobiography]({{ '/ai/the-digital-self/' | relative_url }})
An AI‑generated autobiography from my tweet export (5,384 tweets, 2011–2025). A creative reconstruction exploring how narrative and “voice” emerge from a long public feed.
