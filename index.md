# Hi, I’m Prakhar 👋

I'm a Strategy professional. 

I bring together research and data to uncover insights, turn them into business strategy, and work across teams to make ideas real.

This site is where I document selected work and ongoing explorations — spanning AI, strategy, travel, and fitness.
