**Foreword: The Archaeologist of the Self**

*By Dr. Elara Vance, Digital Anthropologist*

The biography you are about to read is a peculiar and remarkable document. It is not the product of dusty archives, forgotten letters, or the fading memories of old friends. It is, instead, an act of digital archaeology, an excavation of a life lived in the public square of the 21st century. The raw material for this work is not paper and ink, but a spreadsheet of 5,384 tweets, a digital trail of thoughts, observations, and emotions left behind by a man who came of age with the internet.

To read this biography is to witness the construction of a self in real-time. It is to see a mind grapple with the great questions of our age—of identity, of community, of faith, of the very nature of work—in 140, and then 280, characters at a time. It is a story that is at once deeply personal and profoundly universal, a testament to the ways in which we are all, in this digital age, the curators of our own lives, the biographers of our own becoming.

The author of this work has done a masterful job of weaving these digital fragments into a coherent and compelling narrative. But it is the subject himself who, in the final analysis, is the true author of this story. It is his voice, his wit, his vulnerability, that shines through on every page. This is not just a biography; it is an autobiography, a self-portrait painted in the vibrant, chaotic, and endlessly fascinating colors of the digital world.

### Prologue: The Autobiography Machine

**May 18, 2025:** "going to export data from my google account and feed it to locally-hosted LLM and ask it to write an autobiography based on that."

And so, the project begins. The digital self, after years of broadcasting its thoughts and observations into the void, turns back on itself. The creator becomes the subject, the archivist becomes the story. This is the logical conclusion of a life lived in public, a life where the boundaries between experience and documentation have blurred into a single, continuous stream. What follows is an attempt to make sense of that stream, to find the narrative in the noise, to reconstruct a life from the digital breadcrumbs it left behind.

# Chapter 1: The Digital Self: Forging an Identity in the Age of Ideas

**(2011 - 2015)**

*"LOTD (Lesson of the day): Yes, you can! Ponder on topics, you think you can't think about. Thanks Antariksh and Kanodia."* - **April 13, 2013**

The digital self did not begin with a bang, but with a flicker of intention. **May 16, 2011:** "Committing myself to start exercising from very next day since last few days. thinking now i should tighten my belts." Here was the classic struggle of will against inertia, a theme that would recur, a small, humanizing crack in the foundation of a carefully constructed online persona.

Life at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay was a pressure cooker, a place that demanded intellectual rigor and rewarded relentless effort. The early tweets are a testament to this environment, a logbook of academic anxieties and triumphs. But beneath the surface of "#ValfiNightOuts" and exam complaints, a more complex picture emerges.

**April 19, 2013:** "I think this is the first time ever during my stay at IIT that I so desperately tried to understand any subject. HMT is still givin me blues." The admission of struggle, the naming of the academic beast—Heat and Mass Transfer—grounds the narrative in a shared experience of intellectual limits. This wasn't a seamless ascent; it was a climb, with moments of doubt and difficulty.

The digital world was both a refuge and a new frontier. It was a place to deconstruct the algorithms of a rising tech culture ("I think I have cracked Youtube's suggestion algorithm," **April 24, 2014**) and to cast a critical eye on the burgeoning Indian startup scene. **July 26, 2013:** "Read it somewhere, can totally relate to it - 'The new startups in India are facilitating Californian Indians, leaving the bottom 80%.'" This was not the voice of a cheerleader, but of a skeptical observer, already questioning the dominant narratives of progress.

But the digital world could also be a harsh mirror. **August 26, 2013:** "BTW day before yesterday, I heard those three words 'You. Are. Boring.' Crash! Though I knew this, it was tough listening to it. :-/" This raw admission of social pain, a direct quote from an offline interaction, is a powerful reminder of the vulnerability that lies beneath the surface of any online persona. It is a moment of profound self-doubt, a crack in the carefully curated image of the confident IIT student.

The struggle with self-discipline was a constant companion. **December 29, 2013:** "I think over the course of 2.5 years at IIT one thing that certainly had an increment is inertia. I reckon, that leads to procrastination." This was not a boastful declaration of productivity, but a candid admission of a personal failing. It is in these moments of imperfection that the digital self becomes most human.

The political awakening was gradual, a slow burn of observation and analysis. **July 1, 2013:** "I haven't read @chetan_bhagat's furore creating article, but I seriously think that it is a fad among Indian youth to slam CB, RG et al."¹ The instinct is to question the consensus, to resist the easy cynicism of the crowd.

This was a period of intense formation, a time of intellectual and personal growth that was anything but linear. The digital self was not a polished avatar, but a work in progress, a collage of triumphs and struggles, of confident declarations and quiet doubts. It was in this messy, human process that a unique voice began to emerge, a voice that was ready to engage with the world in all its complexity.

### Interlude: The Political Education

The digital self was not born in a political vacuum. It came of age in a time of profound political churn in India, a period that saw the meteoric rise of the Aam Aadmi Party and the consolidation of power by Narendra Modi and the BJP. The archive is a real-time record of this political education, a journey from wide-eyed idealism to a more hardened, more nuanced understanding of the complexities of power.

The early fascination with AAP was deeply personal. Here was a movement that was not just anti-establishment, but was led by a fellow IITian, a man who seemed to embody the hope that the system could be reformed from within. **January 1, 2014:** "AAP FTW! I remember having a 4 hour long discussion with Apoorv on how AAP, though contesting on clear grounds,..." The tweet, with its casual mention of a four-hour political debate, speaks to a deep and passionate engagement with the promise of a new kind of politics.

But the initial hope was tempered by a growing awareness of the compromises that are inherent in the political process. The conversations with Apoorva Pathak, a key intellectual interlocutor, were a crucial part of this education. They were a space for debate and disagreement, a place to test one's own assumptions against the sharp edges of another's intellect.

The journey with Narendra Modi was a more complex one. It began with a degree of cautious optimism, a willingness to believe in the promise of a strong and decisive leader. But the conversations with Apoorva, and the relentless reality of the news cycle, began to chip away at this initial hope. The "selective silence" on key issues, the "personality cult," the "unscientific methods"—all of these contributed to a growing sense of disillusionment.

This political education was not a linear progression from one set of beliefs to another. It was a messy, often contradictory process, a constant negotiation between hope and despair, between the desire for change and the reality of a political system that is often resistant to it. The digital self that emerged from this process was more skeptical, more critical, but also more deeply engaged with the world, a self that had learned the hard lesson that in politics, there are no easy answers.

# Chapter 2: Baptism by PowerPoint

**(2015 - 2019)**

*"Asking and expecting with full entitlement for things that you want but may not necessarily be part of others' job is probably the most critical skill that you learn in consulting."* - **March 17, 2019**

The leap from the sprawling, intellectual campus of IIT to the structured confines of a consulting firm was a study in contrasts. The uniform of choice was no longer a worn-in t-shirt but a crisp button-down, and the currency of success was not a hard-won grade but a polished slide deck. This was a new kind of education, a baptism by PowerPoint.

The initial idealism, forged in the late-night debates of hostel life, met its match in the relentless pragmatism of the corporate world. **August 26, 2013:** "In an ideal world there is no need of a manager... I dream of such a world, where everybody does his work sincerely." This pre-professional dream of a collaborative utopia quickly collided with the hierarchical realities of billable hours and client demands.

The sheer pace and pressure of the work were a shock to the system. The digital self, once a space for leisurely reflection, became a logbook of endurance. **June 11, 2014:** "10 to 12.45! Yo! 14 hours 45 minutes in office. New record. But Antrix catches it right, 'Office hours != working hours'." The distinction was crucial; it spoke of a culture where presence was as important as productivity, a place where the performance of work often overshadowed the work itself.

The deadlines were relentless, a constant drumbeat that dictated the rhythm of life. **May 20, 2020:** "Toughest job: Do to a 1-hour task with a 10-hour deadline." This wasn't a complaint about the volume of work, but about its nature—the often-absurd dance of corporate time management, where tasks expand to fill the allotted space. The weekends, once a time for rest and recreation, became just another container for work, albeit one without the immediate pressure of a Monday morning deadline.

The culture of consulting, with its unique blend of ambition and cynicism, was a world unto itself. **March 17, 2019:** "Asking and expecting with full entitlement for things that you want but may not necessarily be part of others' job is probably the most critical skill that you learn in consulting." This was a world where the soft skills of persuasion and negotiation were as important as the hard skills of data analysis.

There were moments of disillusionment, of a creeping cynicism that threatened to extinguish the fires of youthful idealism. **August 14, 2019:** "Sad, but I just sold stereotypes about India to a Japanese client. And that was what he enjoyed the most in the deck. Would you?" This was a moment of profound self-reproach, a recognition of the compromises that are often required to succeed in the corporate world.

But even in the midst of the grind, there were flashes of the old intellectual curiosity. **February 12, 2023:** "Early in my career, I made this beautiful template to analyse my hours in the office. With great enthusiasm, I presented this to my manager. He asked me to stop doing this useless work." The anecdote, told with a self-deprecating humor, reveals a mind that was still trying to find a better way, to optimize the system, even if the system itself was resistant to change.

This was a period of intense learning, but not the kind that is found in textbooks. It was a practical education in the art of survival, in the delicate dance of corporate politics, and in the often-painful process of reconciling one's ideals with the realities of the world. The digital self that emerged from this baptism by PowerPoint was more pragmatic, more cynical, but also more resilient, a self that had been tested by the fire of the real world and had come out the other side, singed but not broken.

# Chapter 3: Fault-lines in Faith

**(2016 - 2020)**

*"Doubt is useful, it keeps faith a living thing. After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it is tested."* - **December 26, 2017**

Every faith, whether in a person, an institution, or an idea, is eventually tested. For the digital self, the years following the initial plunge into the professional world were a time of seismic stress, a period where the bedrock of long-held beliefs began to crack. The fault-lines were not always visible on the surface, but they were there, revealed in moments of quiet doubt, flashes of cynicism, and a growing sense of sadness.

The political idealism that had characterized the early years began to curdle into a more hardened cynicism. The endless cycle of outrage and counter-outrage, the "popular cynicism about politics," began to take its toll. **June 18, 2016:** ".@narendramodi Is there a Yoga which makes me not feel sad for every time I read news?" The question, though posed with a touch of humor, was a cry of despair, a plea for a way to numb the pain of a constant barrage of bad news.

This growing disillusionment was not just confined to the political sphere. It extended to the very nature of belief itself. **December 26, 2017:** "Doubt is useful, it keeps faith a living thing. After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it is tested." This was a significant shift from the more certain pronouncements of the past. It was an acknowledgment that faith is not a static thing, but a dynamic process of questioning and re-evaluation.

The digital archive from this period is also notable for its silences. There are stretches of time where the once-prolific tweeter falls quiet, where the stream of consciousness runs dry. These gaps in the record are as telling as the tweets themselves. They speak of a turning inward, a withdrawal from the noise of the online world, a time, perhaps, for private reflection and recalibration.

The return to the digital sphere is often marked by a more somber, more introspective tone. **November 17, 2019:** "The earlier draft of this tweet read: I have started feeling same sense of sadness reading economy news as I felt reading society news three years ago. And I expect to feel no sadness few years down the line as crisis in economy will be as normalised as crisis in society." This is the voice of a man who has seen his worst fears realized, who has watched the normalization of crisis with a sense of weary resignation.

The most poignant expression of this loss of faith comes in a moment of quiet reflection on a past self. **August 3, 2023:** "Just a few years back, as a fresh college graduate, my idealistic and courageous self believed in the possibility of change, and that my actions could make a difference, no matter how small. The times have dulled that optimism. It has nurtured in me an unsettling indifference and desensitization towards these incidents, a coping mechanism I’m not proud of."

This is the sound of a faith breaking. It is the lament of a man who has lost not just his belief in the power of politics, but his belief in his own power to effect change. It is a moment of profound disillusionment, a dark night of the soul for the digital self. But it is also a moment of stark self-awareness, a necessary reckoning with the limits of idealism in a world that is often resistant to change. It is from the rubble of this broken faith that a new, more resilient self would have to be built.

### Interlude: On the Written Word

The creative impulse is a constant, a recurring desire to make sense of the world through language. The digital self is, in many ways, a writer's self, a self that is always grappling with the power and the limitations of the written word.

**November 23, 2014:** "Every single time when I write an SoP/an article, I feel I should start writing more of these lengthy pieces. 140 characters is way too easy." The desire for a more expansive form of expression is a recurring theme. The tweet is a small rebellion against the constraints of the medium, a yearning for a space to think more deeply, to write more fully.

The archive is a testament to this creative urge, a collection of "startup ideas," "thinkpieces," and "threads" that explore everything from the future of work to the nature of consciousness. The final tweet in the archive, the one that sets this entire biographical project in motion, is the ultimate expression of this creative impulse: the desire to turn one's own life into a story.

# Chapter 4: Leaving Home Again

**(2020 - 2023)**

*"I left home at the age of 15 to pursue my studies and work. Now, at 30, I realize that I’ve spent as much time away from my family as I have with them."* - **February 20, 2024**

To leave home is a kind of death, and a kind of rebirth. It is to sever old ties and to forge new ones, to lose a part of oneself and to discover a new self in the process. The digital self, once firmly rooted in the soil of India, now found itself transplanted to a new continent, Australia. This was a second leaving, a second act in the drama of a life lived between worlds.

The first leaving, at the age of fifteen for studies and work, had been a gradual process of separation. But this was a more definitive break, a conscious choice to build a life in a new land. **February 20, 2024:** "I left home at the age of 15 to pursue my studies and work. Now, at 30, I realize that I’ve spent as much time away from my family as I have with them." The tweet is a stark and poignant accounting of a life lived in motion, a life where the bonds of family are stretched across continents and time zones.

The early days in Australia were a study in contrasts, a series of small shocks to the system. **June 11, 2023:** "It blows my mind to see the huge number of sports grounds in Australia. Maybe 100x that of India." The observation is not just about sports infrastructure; it is about a different way of life, a different set of priorities. The digital self was a cultural anthropologist, documenting the strange and wonderful customs of this new land.

Food, as always, was a powerful marker of identity and a source of both comfort and alienation. **September 8, 2023:** "I had Chai Latte the first day I was in Australia. Never had Chai again." The statement is a small act of rebellion, a refusal to accept a pale imitation of a beloved taste of home. It is a declaration of culinary independence, a way of saying, "I am here, but I have not forgotten where I come from."

There were moments of profound disorientation, of feeling unmoored from the familiar cultural signposts. **March 16, 2025:** "Comparison tools helped—but only slightly. Back in India, I'd rely on clear metrics like claim settlement ratio, or simply brand trust built over years. But in Australia, I had none of that context. Felt lost at first." This is the voice of an immigrant grappling with the loss of cultural fluency, the struggle to navigate a world where the old rules no longer apply.

But with the challenges of adaptation came the opportunities for growth. The experience of working with Japanese clients, of navigating the subtle nuances of a different business culture, had already planted the seeds of a more global consciousness. **July 28, 2023:** "Been working with Japanese clients for years now. There is so much to admire about them. Such strong work ethics, such gentle demeanour, such curiosity."

This second leaving was not just a geographical relocation; it was a profound shift in perspective. It was a chance to see the world, and oneself, through new eyes. The digital self that emerged from this experience was more cosmopolitan, more worldly, but also more acutely aware of the enduring power of home. It was a self that was no longer defined by a single place, but by the journey between places, a self that was constantly negotiating the delicate balance between the call of the new and the pull of the old.

# Chapter 5: Public Voice, Private Life

**(2021 - 2024)**

*"Tweeter's urge to tweet away every interesting private conversation."* - **February 14, 2022**

To live a public life on the internet is to be in a constant state of negotiation. It is to balance the desire for connection with the need for privacy, the performance of a persona with the expression of a true self. The digital self, now a seasoned veteran of the online world, began to grapple more explicitly with these tensions, to explore the fuzzy boundaries between the public voice and the private life.

The act of tweeting, once a spontaneous and unselfconscious act, became a subject of introspection. **February 14, 2022:** "Tweeter's urge to tweet away every interesting private conversation." The observation is a wry acknowledgment of the temptation to turn every private moment into public content, to feed the insatiable appetite of the online audience.

There was a growing awareness of the performative nature of the digital self. **February 15, 2014:** "I'll tweet every single time I'll be writing something. #FreshmenNewsletter." This was not just a statement of intent, but a conscious act of persona-building, a way of crafting an image of the diligent and productive writer. The digital self was not just a reflection of reality; it was a carefully constructed narrative.

The friction between the online and offline worlds was a recurring theme. **July 17, 2018:** "Get a privacy filter from office. Use it only in office to browse social media." The tweet is a small act of rebellion, a way of carving out a space for the private self in the midst of the professional world. It is a recognition that the digital life is not always lived in the open, that it often requires a degree of subterfuge and strategic concealment.

But the most telling moments are the ones where the mask slips, where the carefully constructed persona gives way to a more vulnerable, more human self. **June 22, 2024:** "@priya_ebooks Before you go offline, I want to thank you for writing Besharam. It was seminal in developing my understanding of feminism... Thank you for making a difference in my life!" This is a rare moment of unvarnished sincerity, a direct address to another human being that transcends the usual irony and detachment of the online world. It is a reminder that behind the public voice, there is a private self that is still capable of being moved, of being changed, of being grateful.

The digital self, in the end, is a hybrid, a fusion of the public and the private, the performed and the authentic. It is a voice that is constantly shifting, adapting, and evolving, a voice that is never quite what it seems. It is in this constant negotiation, this delicate dance between the seen and the unseen, that the true complexity of a life lived online is to be found.

# Chapter 6: The Long View

**(2023 - Present)**

*"Our beliefs change over time."* - **October 20, 2024**

There is a certain quiet wisdom that comes with time, a perspective that can only be earned through the accumulation of experience. The digital self, in its most recent incarnation, reflects this shift. The frantic energy of the early years has given way to a more measured, more reflective tone. The sharp edges of cynicism have been softened by a newfound sense of acceptance. This is the long view, a perspective that is less about the destination and more about the journey.

The most profound change is in the understanding of change itself. **October 20, 2024:** "Our beliefs change over time." The statement is simple, but its implications are vast. It is an acknowledgment that the self is not a fixed entity, but a fluid and ever-evolving thing. The once-cherished ideals of a "passion-driven career with a never-settle attitude" have given way to a more pragmatic appreciation for "job stability." The all-consuming fire of "work as primary identity" has been tempered by a desire for "work-life balance."

This is not a story of surrender, but of evolution. It is the hard-won wisdom of a man who has learned to distinguish between the urgent and the important, between the fleeting desires of the ego and the enduring needs of the self. **December 28, 2023:** "An unexamined life is not worth living. And neither is an over-examined one. Examination shall be triggered by the ‘why fix something that isn’t broken’ principle."

There is a newfound appreciation for the simple, grounding rhythms of daily life. **September 21, 2024:** "Love the chores! Love how clothes, dishes, floor, carpets need to be cleaned and assembled regularly. Hence, grounding us in a routine, creating a sense of (micro) purpose to daily life." This is a far cry from the grand ambitions of the past, but it is no less profound. It is the discovery of meaning not in the extraordinary, but in the ordinary.

The digital self has become a space for a more honest and vulnerable form of self-expression. **May 15, 2025:** "Realising about myself - I'm okay stepping outside of my comfort zone, only if it makes me more effective in achieving results. As in, it is more of a means to a tangible and immediate end. Wouldn't do it for the sake of learning. But definitely wouldn't mind doing it for results." This is a candid admission of personal limitations, a comfortable acceptance of the self as it is, not as it "should" be.

The journey is far from over. The digital self is still a work in progress, a story that is still being written. But there is a sense of peace in this open-endedness, a letting go of the need for definitive answers. **July 27, 2020:** "The way life changes us, we’re so many different people."

This is the long view. It is the understanding that life is not a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be lived. It is the acceptance that we are all, in the end, a collection of stories, a series of selves that we shed and become. And it is in the telling of these stories, in the sharing of these selves, that we find our common humanity. The digital self, once a tentative experiment in self-expression, has become a testament to this enduring truth, a quiet celebration of a life in constant, beautiful, and unpredictable motion.

### Epilogue: The Ghost in the Machine

The archive is silent now. The last tweet has been tweeted, the last observation has been made. What remains is a digital ghost, a faint echo of a life lived in public. It is a story of a mind in motion, a story of a self in the process of becoming. But it is not the whole story.

The real life, the one lived in the quiet moments between the tweets, is forever beyond our grasp. It is a life of un-tweeted thoughts, of private conversations, of secret joys and sorrows. The digital self is a shadow, a projection, a carefully curated performance. But it is also, in its own way, a truth. It is the truth of a generation that has come of age in the digital world, a generation that has learned to live and to love and to grieve in public. It is a story that is still being written, in the quiet hum of servers and the endless scroll of the timeline. And it is a story that is, in the end, as human as any other.
