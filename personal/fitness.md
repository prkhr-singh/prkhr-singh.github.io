# Fitness

## Philosophy
I’m not chasing aesthetics. Optimising for looks alone feels counter-productive, even unhealthy. My focus is functional fitness: gradual improvement, consistency, and the ability to enjoy life — whether that’s a long hike, a weekend ride, or a casual game with friends.

I believe everything we know about good health should be carried into daily life. Fitness is not just about extending lifespan, but about extending **healthspan** — staying free from preventable lifestyle diseases and living with energy and quality of life. I feel fortunate to have this awareness now, and my aim is to act on it.

## Why I Started
Moving to Melbourne gave me both inspiration and opportunity. I found myself surrounded by people who took fitness seriously—marathon runners, ex-Olympians, AFL players, even colleagues at work. Add to that a better work–life balance, and I finally had the space to commit to fitness as part of daily life.

## What I Do
- **Cardio**: ~120 minutes of zone-2 work each week, plus one high-intensity VO₂ max session (usually a Norwegian run).
- **Strength**: Twice-weekly sessions covering major muscle groups at the apartment gym. Self-taught with help from ChatGPT and YouTube.
- **Conditioning**: Two yoga sessions per week and a mandatory stretch after every workout. Game-changer for recovery and consistency.

## The Basics
- **Sleep**: Targeting 8 hours nightly.
- **Nutrition**: Protein-first—scoop of whey in the morning, meat in main meals, more fibre, less sugar (still a work in progress).
- **Supplements**: Creatine daily. No other supplements unless a deficiency is tested and confirmed.

## Tools I Use
- **Apple Watch**: Clear inflection point in my fitness data once I started tracking.
- **Hevy**: For strength training logs and sticking to routines.
- **Strava (free)**: Auto-sync from Apple Watch.
- **AllTrails**: Great for discovering Melbourne hikes (though the nearby options are mostly ticked off now).

## Companions & Motivation
- **Cycling**: Exploring Melbourne’s neighbourhoods and trails.
- **Gym & Running**: Dedicated time for podcasts—longform conversations on tech, politics, and science.
- **Yoga**: A meditative reset.

## Teachers & Influences
- **Running**: Ash
- **Yoga**: Yoga with Kassandra
- **Strength**: GrowingAnanas (home workouts)
- **Science & Optimisation**: Huberman Lab, Peter Attia
- **Cautionary Benchmark**: Watching Bryan Johnson’s experiments, but not copying them.

## Goals
- Keep a sustainable, enjoyable routine.
- Improve gradually over time.
- A playful OKR: **Abs (VO₂ max) > Abs (resting heart rate)**.
