I’m **Prakhar Singh**, working in **Strategy & Planning (Competition Intelligence & Geo‑Strategy)** at **Uber Eats ANZ**.  
My happy place is where **data, product intuition, and operations** meet. I like turning messy questions into simple, actionable decisions.

**Interests:** AI & strategy, travel & photography, coffee (moka‑pot mastery), and cycling around Melbourne.

This site is intentionally minimal: fast to load, easy to maintain, and friendly to both humans and AI.
