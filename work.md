- Methods ranging from surveys and interviews to ethnography and digital listening  

### Insight  
- Competitive and market intelligence to shape investment choices  
- Translating data into clear artefacts — reports, dashboards, and decision memos  

### Strategy  
- Go-to-market, expansion, and transformation strategies across industries  
- Policy, partnership, and investment strategy for both corporate and government clients  

### Implementation  
- Running pilots, coordinating multi-stakeholder teams, and scaling programs  
- Leading cross-functional execution linking product, operations, marketing, and comms
