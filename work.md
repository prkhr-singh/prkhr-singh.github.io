Here are a few highlight areas I gravitate to. I’ll expand these into short case notes over time.

### Strategy & Planning — Uber Eats ANZ
- Geo‑strategy & competitive intelligence to inform where and how we win.
- Cross‑functional projects that link **data**, **ops**, and **comms** for crisp execution.
- Social impact & “Tech for Good” initiatives I care about personally.

### Analysis → Insight → Decision
- Light modelling and strong narrative to help leaders choose with confidence.
- Clear artefacts: one‑pagers, write‑ups, and dashboards that survive the meeting.

### Systems & Automation
- Simple automations and AI agent workflows that save hours and reduce errors.
- Documentation that’s good enough for someone else to pick up tomorrow.

If you’d like the formal version, see the **[CV]({{ '/cv/' | relative_url }})**.
